stylish-styles
==============

I'm normally quite happy to use the styles created by others.  I just want it to be dark, easy on the eyes and work.  Unfortunately some sites I use regularly will not work with the default styles, particularly interactive things like chess boards.  So that's what this repo is for, the things I absolutely have to do myself.
