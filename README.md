stylish-styles
==============

I'm normally quite happy to use the styles created by others.  I just want it to be dark, easy on the eyes and work.  Unfortunately some sites I use regularly will not work with the default styles, particularly interactive things like chess boards.  So that's what this repo is for, the things I absolutely have to do myself.


DotJS
-----

These CSS themes will also work with the DotJS extension for Firefox and Chrome.  In that case they will need to be renamed to the domain name of the website with the .css extension appended.  So ello-ello.css would need to be renamed to ello.co.css when copied into the ~/.css/ directory.
